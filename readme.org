* Introduction
  - My personal emacs config, with minimal custom code and modern emacs config style
* Evil
  - Why don't I use evil ?
  - When I basically lost all use of my left hand, I switched to default emacs
    bindings, and I guess I got used to them
  - Also, evil isn't really built for dvorak
  - But evil is quite nice, I like it a lot
